# hello-world
welcome to the hello-world where everyone says hello.
I’m Moon, and coding is my passion. There’s something about the challenge of solving problems and building something from scratch that just clicks with me. Whether it’s tweaking an algorithm, creating a sleek interface, or writing lines of code that come together in perfect harmony, I thrive in the world of logic and creativity.

I love diving deep into code, experimenting with new languages, and pushing the limits of what technology can do. But don’t let the focus on coding fool you—I also enjoy the process of troubleshooting, finding solutions to those stubborn bugs, and seeing a project evolve from an idea into a functioning piece of software.

Coding isn’t just a skill for me; it’s a way of thinking, a way of looking at the world and breaking down problems into manageable pieces. And when I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me exploring new tech trends, learning something new, or looking for ways to automate the little things that make life easier.
